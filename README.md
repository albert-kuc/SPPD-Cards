# South Park Phone Destroyer - Game Cards


## Overview

This is the final training project for QA Academy Software Development program. 
It encapsulates concepts from all core modules:
* Agile & Project Management (Git, Jira)
* Databases & Cloud Fundamentals (H2, MySQL)
* Programming Fundamentals (Java)
* API Development (Spring Boot)
* Automated Testing (JUnit)
Additionally it is fully CRUD functional, handles HTTP request and communicates with a database.

The project is a Spring Boot App customised to emulate cards from m/obile game South Park Phone Destroyer 
([Google Play link](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubisoft.dragonfire&hl=en_GB&gl=US)).
In the most basic form, it allows to create, read, update and delete card objects from a database.
This results in an application back-end, with cloud based database.
